## **Spring RabbitMQ Consumer**
## Overview
This repository serves as a basic example to help you kickstart your development with a Spring RabbitMQ consumer. RabbitMQ is a widely-used message broker that facilitates communication between different applications. This example focuses on setting up a consumer using the Spring framework, which simplifies the integration process and provides robust support for messaging operations.
## Getting Started
To get started with this example, follow these stepsðŸ¤Ÿ
- **Clone the Repository:**
 <br>Clone this repository to your local machine using the following commandðŸŒ€ </br>
```
git clone https:
 ```
- **Install Dependencies:** 
<br>Ensure you have Maven installed on your machine. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install dependencies:</br>
```
mvn clean install

```
 - **Configure RabbitMQ:**
<br>Before running the consumer, make sure you have RabbitMQ installed and running on your system. You may need to configure RabbitMQ connection details such as host, port, username, and password in the application properties file.ðŸ¥‡</br>
- **Run the Consumer:** 
<br>Once RabbitMQ is configured, you can run the consumer application. Execute the following Maven commandðŸ˜ƒ</br>
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
- **Verify Operation:** 
<br>After the consumer is running, verify that it successfully connects to RabbitMQ and starts consuming messages. You can check the console output for any log messages indicating successful consumption.</br>
